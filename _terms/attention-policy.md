# attention policy

## Definition
A policy that governs how inbound signals are admitted, deferred, summarized, rerouted, escalated, or rejected before reaching a principal or downstream decision layer.

## Reader Note
This term was added following a cross-repository terminology review of TSMM, TIS, TGA, and the DTG ZKP Task Force workspace.

## Implementation Relevance
Use this term to keep runtime governance, delegation, evidence, and privacy semantics consistent across interoperating trust infrastructure repositories.

## Aliases
attention policy, attention-policy
