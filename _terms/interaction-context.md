# Interaction Context

## Definition
A session-level governance envelope that groups related tasks, messages, authority, evidence, and trust decisions across a sequence of interactions.

## Reader Note
This term was added following a cross-repository terminology review of TSMM, TIS, TGA, and the DTG ZKP Task Force workspace.

## Implementation Relevance
Use this term to keep runtime governance, delegation, evidence, and privacy semantics consistent across interoperating trust infrastructure repositories.

## Aliases
interaction context, interaction-context
