- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_credential): Digital credentials are the digital equivalent of paper-based [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credentials). Just as a paper-based credential could be a [passport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport), a [driver's license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver%27s_license), a membership certificate or some kind of ticket to obtain some service, such as a cinema ticket or a public transport ticket, a digital credential is a proof of qualification, competence, or clearance that is attached to a person.
