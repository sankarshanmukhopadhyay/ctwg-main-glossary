# peer trust relation

## Definition
A lateral trust relationship between parties that do not hold hierarchical authority over one another and that rely on an explicit trust basis such as credential exchange, policy acceptance, or third-party introduction.

## Reader Note
This term was added following a cross-repository terminology review of TSMM, TIS, TGA, and the DTG ZKP Task Force workspace.

## Implementation Relevance
Use this term to keep runtime governance, delegation, evidence, and privacy semantics consistent across interoperating trust infrastructure repositories.

## Aliases
peer trust relation, peer-trust-relation
