# Content Provenance Policy

## Definition
A governance policy that specifies what provenance, integrity, sanitization, redaction, and evidence conditions must be satisfied before content may be acted upon, stored, or forwarded.

## Reader Note
This term was added following a cross-repository terminology review of TSMM, TIS, TGA, and the DTG ZKP Task Force workspace.

## Implementation Relevance
Use this term to keep runtime governance, delegation, evidence, and privacy semantics consistent across interoperating trust infrastructure repositories.

## Aliases
content provenance policy, content-provenance-policy
