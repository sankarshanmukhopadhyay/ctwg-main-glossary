# legitimacy gap

## Definition
A mismatch between an action or decision that a system can technically execute and the authority, recognition, consent, or governance basis required for that action to be legitimate.

## Reader Note
This term was added following a cross-repository terminology review of TSMM, TIS, TGA, and the DTG ZKP Task Force workspace.

## Implementation Relevance
Use this term to keep runtime governance, delegation, evidence, and privacy semantics consistent across interoperating trust infrastructure repositories.

## Aliases
legitimacy gap, legitimacy-gap
