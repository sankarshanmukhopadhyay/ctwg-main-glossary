[[def: issuer, issuer, issuers]]

~ A [[ref: role]] an [[ref: agent]] performs to assert a set of [[ref: claims]], package and [[ref: digitally sign]] them, typically in the form of a [[ref: digital credential]], and transmit them to a [[ref: holder]] under applicable policy and governance constraints.

~ Note: An issuer commonly bears responsibility for issuance criteria, status maintenance, and revocation handling relevant to the credentials it issues.
